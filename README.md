The Odin Project HTML/CSS Project 1

This is my first project using HTML and CSS. I played around a bit with divs, classes, and ids for many elements, as well as played around with some transitions. I found that using forms made my button making process much easier when it came to transitions. Silly Buttons. I tried to minimize the imgs that I would be using to see if it would speed up the page to use CSS whenever I could. The problem is that I wanted to get this done, so I didn't do the apps button or the notifications buttion in css, although I was able to get the Profile Pic Icon and the Google logo (modified) with a little Gold hilight.
